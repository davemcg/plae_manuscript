  abstract = {Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) studies profile thousands of cells in heterogeneous environments. Current methods for characterizing cells perform unsupervised analysis followed by assignment using a small set of known marker genes. Such approaches are limited to a few, well characterized cell types. We developed an automated pipeline to download, process, and annotate publicly available scRNA-seq datasets to enable large scale supervised characterization. We extend supervised neural networks to obtain efficient and accurate representations for scRNA-seq data. We apply our pipeline to analyze data from over~500 different studies with over~300 unique cell types and show that supervised methods outperform unsupervised methods for cell type identification. A case study highlights the usefulness of these methods for comparing cell type distributions in healthy and diseased mice. Finally, we present scQuery, a web server which uses our neural networks and fast matching methods to determine cell types, key genes, and more., Publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets represent valuable resources for comparative and meta-analysis. Here, the authors develop scQuery, a web server integrating over 500 different studies with over 300 unique cell types for comparative analysis of existing and new scRNA-seq data.},

Recent technological developments in single-cell analysis have enabled high-throughput profiling of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and spatial relationships amongst cells in complex tissues, but computational approaches that deliver a sensitive and specific joint analysis of these datasets are lacking. We developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity, allowing flexible modeling of highly heterogeneous single-cell datasets. We demonstrated its broad utility by applying it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined both cell-type-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, an anatomically complex brain region that plays important roles in sex-specific behaviors. Second, we analyzed gene expression in the substantia nigra of seven postmortem human subjects, comparing cell states in specific donors, and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we jointly leveraged \emph{in situ} gene expression and scRNA-seq data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we integrated mouse cortical scRNA-seq profiles with single-cell DNA methylation signatures, revealing mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene regulation. Integrative analyses using the LIGER algorithm promise to accelerate single-cell investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background: During development of the vertebrate eye, there is a series of reciprocal cellular interactions that determine the fate of the eye components. Although evidence from organ culture suggests that the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) organizes the laminar structure of the differentiated neural retina, no role has been identified for the RPE in early eye development, nor has the later function of RPE been demonstrated in vivo. Results To investigate the role of RPE cells in eye development, we generated transgenic mice that carry the attenuated diphtheria toxin-A gene; this transgene was driven by the promoter of the gene encoding the tyrosinase-related protein-1, which is specifically expressed in pigment cells. Depending on the expression level of the transgene, the retinal epithelium was ablated before or after its differentiation into a pigmented cell layer. We show that an early ablation (embryonic day E10-11) resulted in disorganization of the retinal layer, immediate arrest of eye growth and subsequent eye resorption. A later ablation (E11.5–12.5) allowed the eye to be maintained during embryogenesis, but the laminar structure of the retina became disrupted by the end of gestation, the vitreous failed to accumulate and adults were anophthalmic or severely microphthalmic. In some microphthalmic eyes, a number of RPE cells escaped ablation and formed patches of pigmented cells; the laminar structure of the retina was maintained immediately adjacent to such pigmented areas but disrupted elsewhere. In both cases — early or late ablation of the RPE — the retina appears to be the primary affected tissue. Conclusion We conclude that presence of the RPE is required for the normal development of the eye in vivo. Its presence early in development is necessary for the correct morphogenesis of the neural retina. After the neural retina has started to differentiate, the RPE is still necessary, either directly or indirectly, to maintain the organization of the retinal lamina.},

  abstract = {The human retina is a complex tissue responsible for detecting photons of light and converting information from these photons into the neurochemical signals interpreted as vision. Such visual signaling not only requires sophisticated interactions between multiple classes of neurons, but also spatially-dependent molecular specialization of individual cell types. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on neural retina isolated from both the fovea and peripheral retina in three human donors. We recovered a total of 8,217 cells, with 3,578 cells originating from the fovea and 4,639 cells originating from the periphery. Expression profiles for all major retinal cell types were compiled, and differential expression analysis was performed between cells of foveal versus peripheral origin. Globally, mRNA for the serum iron binding protein transferrin (TF), which has been associated with age-related macular degeneration pathogenesis, was enriched in peripheral samples. Cone photoreceptor cells were of particular interest and formed two predominant clusters based on gene expression. One cone cluster had 96\% of cells originating from foveal samples, while the second cone cluster consisted exclusively of peripherally isolated cells. A total of 148 genes were differentially expressed between cones from the fovea versus periphery. Interestingly, peripheral cones were enriched for the gene encoding Beta-Carotene Oxygenase 2 (BCO2). A relative deficiency of this enzyme may account for the accumulation of carotenoids responsible for yellow pigment deposition within the macula. Overall, this data set provides rich expression profiles of the major human retinal cell types and highlights transcriptomic features that distinguish foveal and peripheral cells.},

Retinal neurons have high energy requirements, since large amounts of ATP are needed to generate membrane potentials and power membrane pumps. Mitochondria over the course of aging undergo a number of changes. Aged mitochondria exhibit decreased rates of oxidative phosphorylation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased numbers of mtDNA mutations. Mitochondria in the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage with aging. Many age-related retinal diseases, including glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, mitochondria are a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of retinal disease.},

It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a~non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

However, the cellular heterogeneity of the developing CNS has posed a major obstacle to identifying the gene regulatory networks that control these processes. To address this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile ten developmental stages encompassing the full course of retinal neurogenesis. This allowed us to comprehensively characterize changes in gene expression that occur during initiation of neurogenesis, changes in developmental competence, and specification and differentiation of each major retinal cell type. We identify the NFI transcription factors (Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix) as selectively expressed in late retinal progenitor cells and show that they control bipolar interneuron and Müller glia cell fate specification and promote proliferative quiescence.},

  abstract = {Retinal bipolar neurons serve as relay interneurons that connect rod and cone photoreceptor cells to amacrine and ganglion cells. They exhibit diverse morphologies essential for correct routing of photoreceptor cell signals to specific postsynaptic amacrine and ganglion cells. The development and physiology of these interneurons have not been completely defined molecularly. Despite previous identification of genes expressed in several bipolar cell subtypes, molecules that mark each bipolar cell type still await discovery. In this report, novel genetic markers of murine bipolar cells were found. Candidates were initially generated by using microarray analysis of single bipolar cells and mining of retinal serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. These candidates were subsequently tested for expression in bipolar cells by RNA in situ hybridization. Ten new molecular markers were identified, five of which are highly enriched in their expression in bipolar cells within the adult retina. Double-labeling experiments using probes for previously characterized subsets of bipolar cells were performed to identify the subtypes of bipolar cells that express the novel markers. Additionally, the expression of bipolar cell genes was analyzed in Bhlhb4 knockout retinas, in which rod bipolar cells degenerate postnatally, to delineate further the identity of bipolar cells in which novel markers are found. From the analysis of Bhlhb4 mutant retinas, cone bipolar cell gene expression appears to be relatively unaffected by the degeneration of rod bipolar cells. Identification of molecular markers for the various subtypes of bipolar cells will lead to greater insights into the development and function of these diverse interneurons.},
