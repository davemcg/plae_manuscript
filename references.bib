  abstract = {The more than 1000 single-cell transcriptomics studies that have been published to date constitute a valuable and vast resource for biological discovery. While various `atlas' projects have collated some of the associated datasets, most questions related to specific tissue types, species or other attributes of studies require identifying papers through manual and challenging literature search. To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field. As an example, we show that the number of cell types identified in scRNA-seq studies is proportional to the number of cells analysed.Database URL: www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui},

  abstract = {Purpose: The early transcriptional events that occur in newly generated cone photoreceptors are not well described. Knowledge of these events is critical to provide benchmarks for in vitro-derived cone photoreceptors and to understand the process of cone and rod photoreceptor diversification. We sought to identify genes with differential gene expression in embryonic mouse cone photoreceptors. Methods: The specificity of expression of the LHX4 transcription factor in developing cone photoreceptors was examined using immunofluorescence visualization in both mouse and chicken retinas. A LHX4 transgenic reporter line with high specificity for developing mouse cone photoreceptors was identified and used to purify early-stage cone photoreceptors for profiling by single-cell RNA sequencing. Comparisons were made to previous datasets targeting photoreceptors. Results: The LHX4 transcription factor and a transgenic reporter were determined to be highly specific to early developing cone photoreceptors in the mouse. Single-cell transcriptional profiling identified new genes with enriched expression in cone photoreceptors relative to concurrent cell populations. Comparison to previous profiling datasets allowed for further characterization of these genes across developmental time, species, photoreceptor type, and gene regulatory network. Conclusions: The LHX4 gene is highly enriched in developing cone photoreceptors as are several new genes identified through transcriptional profiling, some of which are expressed in subclusters of cones. Many of these cone-enriched genes do not show obvious de-repression in profiling of retinas mutant for the rod-specific transcription factor NRL, highlighting differences between endogenous cones and those induced in NRL mutants.},

  abstract = {Precise temporal control of gene expression in neuronal progenitors is necessary for correct regulation of neurogenesis and cell fate specification. However, the extensive cellular heterogeneity of the developing CNS has posed a major obstacle to identifying the gene regulatory networks that control these processes. To address this, we used single cell RNA-sequencing to profile ten developmental stages encompassing the full course of retinal neurogenesis. This allowed us to comprehensively characterize changes in gene expression that occur during initiation of neurogenesis, changes in developmental competence, and specification and differentiation of each of the major retinal cell types. These data identify transitions in gene expression between early and late-stage retinal progenitors, as well as a classification of neurogenic progenitors. We identify here the NFI family of transcription factors (Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix) as genes with enriched expression within late RPCs, and show they are regulators of bipolar interneuron and Muller glia specification and the control of proliferative quiescence.},

  abstract = {Death of photoreceptors is a common cause of age-related and inherited retinal dystrophies, and thus their replenishment from renewable stem cell sources is a highly desirable therapeutic goal. Human pluripotent stem cells provide a useful cell source in view of their limitless self-renewal capacity and potential to not only differentiate into cells of the retina but also self-organize into tissue with structure akin to the human retina as part of three-dimensional retinal organoids. Photoreceptor precursors have been isolated from differentiating human pluripotent stem cells through application of cell surface markers or fluorescent reporter approaches and shown to have a similar transcriptome to fetal photoreceptors. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional profile of CRX-expressing photoreceptor precursors derived from human pluripotent stem cells and their engraftment capacity in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa (Pde6brd1), which is characterized by rapid photoreceptor degeneration. Single cell RNA-Seq analysis revealed the presence of a dominant cell cluster comprising 72\% of the cells, which displayed the hallmarks of early cone photoreceptor expression. When transplanted subretinally into the Pde6brd1 mice, the CRX+ cells settled next to the inner nuclear layer and made connections with the inner neurons of the host retina, and approximately one-third of them expressed the pan cone marker, Arrestin 3, indicating further maturation upon integration into the host retina. Together, our data provide valuable molecular insights into the transcriptional profile of human pluripotent stem cells-derived CRX+ photoreceptor precursors and indicate their usefulness as a source of transplantable cone photoreceptors.

To this end, retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) at three time points of differentiation. Combinatorial data from all time points revealed the presence of nine clusters, five of which corresponded to key retinal cell types: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone and rod photoreceptors, and M\"uller glia. The remaining four clusters expressed genes typical of mitotic cells, extracellular matrix components and those involved in homeostasis. The cell clustering analysis revealed the decreasing presence of mitotic cells and RGCs, formation of a distinct RPE cluster, the emergence of cone and rod photoreceptors from photoreceptor precursors, and an increasing number of M\"uller glia cells over time. Pseudo-time analysis resembled the order of cell birth during retinal development, with the mitotic cluster commencing the trajectory and the large majority of M\"uller glia completing the time line. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility and potential of scRNA-Seq to dissect the inherent complexity of retinal organoids and the orderly birth of key retinal cell types.

  abstract = {Thyroid hormone in color vision development Cone photoreceptors in the eye enable color vision, responding to different wavelengths of light according to what opsin pigments they express. Eldred et al. studied organoids that recapitulate the development of the human retina and found that differentiation of cone cells into their tuned subtypes was regulated by thyroid hormone. Cones expressing short-wavelength (S) opsin developed first, and cones expressing long- and medium-wavelength (L/M) opsin developed later. The switch toward development of L/M cones depended on thyroid hormone signaling through the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. Science, this issue p. eaau6348 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONCone photoreceptors in the human retina enable daytime, color, and high-acuity vision. The three subtypes of human cones are defined by the visual pigment that they express: blue-opsin (short wavelength; S), green-opsin (medium wavelength; M), or red-opsin (long wavelength; L). Mutations that affect opsin expression or function cause various forms of color blindness and retinal degeneration. RATIONALEOur current understanding of the vertebrate eye has been derived primarily from the study of model organisms. We studied the human retina to understand the developmental mechanisms that generate the mosaic of mutually exclusive cone subtypes. Specification of human cones occurs in a two-step process. First, a decision occurs between S versus L/M cone fates. If the L/M fate is chosen, a subsequent choice is made between expression of L- or M-opsin. To determine the mechanism that controls the first decision between S and L/M cone fates, we studied human retinal organoids derived from stem cells. RESULTSWe found that human organoids and retinas have similar distributions, gene expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. During development, S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones. This temporal switch from specification of S cones to generation of L/M cones is controlled by thyroid hormone (TH) signaling. In retinal organoids that lacked thyroid hormone receptor {$\beta$} (Thr{$\beta$}), all cones developed into the S subtype. Thr{$\beta$} binds with high affinity to triiodothyronine (T3), the more active form of TH, to regulate gene expression. We observed that addition of T3 early during development induced L/M fate in nearly all cones. Thus, TH signaling through Thr{$\beta$} is necessary and sufficient to induce L/M cone fate and suppress S fate. TH exists largely in two states: thyroxine (T4), the most abundant circulating form of TH, and T3, which binds TH receptors with high affinity. We hypothesized that the retina itself could modulate TH levels to control subtype fates. We found that deiodinase 3 (DIO3), an enzyme that degrades both T3 and T4, was expressed early in organoid and retina development. Conversely, deiodinase 2 (DIO2), an enzyme that converts T4 to active T3, as well as TH carriers and transporters, were expressed later in development. Temporally dynamic expression of TH-degrading and -activating proteins supports a model in which the retina itself controls TH levels, ensuring low TH signaling early to specify S cones and high TH signaling later in development to produce L/M cones. CONCLUSIONStudies of model organisms and human epidemiology often generate hypotheses about human biology that cannot be studied in humans. Organoids provide a system to determine the mechanisms of human development, enabling direct testing of hypotheses in developing human tissue. Our studies identify temporal regulation of TH signaling as a mechanism that controls cone subtype specification in humans. Consistent with our findings, preterm human infants with low T3 and T4 have an increased incidence of color vision defects. Moreover, our identification of a mechanism that generates one cone subtype while suppressing the other, coupled with successful transplantation and incorporation of stem cell\textendash derived photoreceptors in mice, suggests that the promise of therapies to treat human diseases such as color blindness, retinitis pigmentosa, and macular degeneration will be achieved in the near future. {$<$}img class={"}fragment-image{"} aria-describedby={"}F1-caption{"} src={"}http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6411/eaau6348/F1.medium.gif{"}/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Temporally regulated TH signaling specifies cone subtypes.(A) Embryonic stem cell\textendash derived human retinal organoids [wild type (WT)] generate S and L/M cones.

(C) Early activation of TH signaling (WT + T3) specifies nearly all L/M cones. (D) TH-degrading enzymes (such as DIO3) expressed early in development lower TH and promote S fate, whereas TH-activating regulators (such as DIO2) expressed later promote L/M fate. The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the retina enable high-acuity daytime and color vision. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human retinal organoids. Organoids and retinas have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone\textendash degrading and \textendash activating proteins within the retina ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and vision repair.

In the Norrin KO (Ndp                         KO                      ) mouse, a model of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), developmental hypovascularization of the retina produces chronic hypoxia of inner nuclear-layer (INL) neurons and Muller glia. We used single-cell RNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and metabolite labeling from 13C-glucose to compare WT and Ndp                         KO                      retinas. In Ndp                         KO                      retinas, we observe gene expression responses consistent with hypoxia in Muller glia and retinal neurons, and we find a metabolic shift that combines reduced flux through the TCA cycle with increased synthesis of serine, glycine, and glutathione. We also used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the responses of individual cell types in Ndp                         KO                      retinas with those in the hypoxic cerebral cortex of mice that were housed for 1 week in a reduced oxygen environment (7.5\% oxygen). In the hypoxic cerebral cortex, glial transcriptome responses most closely resemble the response of Muller glia in the Ndp                         KO                      retina. In both retina and brain, vascular endothelial cells activate a previously dormant tip cell gene expression program, which likely underlies the adaptive neoangiogenic response to chronic hypoxia. These analyses of retina and brain transcriptomes at single-cell resolution reveal both shared and cell type-specific changes in gene expression in response to chronic hypoxia, implying both shared and distinct cell type-specific physiologic responses.},

We show that RGC maturation follows six waves of gene expression, with older-generated RGCs transcribing increasing amounts of guidance cues for young peripheral RGC axons that express the matching receptors. Spatial transcriptionally deduced features in subpopulations of RGCs allowed us to define novel molecular markers that are spatially restricted. Finally, the isolation of such a spatially restricted population, ipsilateral RGCs, allowed us to identify their molecular identity at the time they execute axon guidance decisions. Together, these data represent a valuable resource shedding light on transcription factor sequences and guidance cue dynamics during mouse retinal development.},

  abstract = {The retina is a specialized neural tissue that senses light and initiates image processing. Although the functional organization of specific retina cells has been well studied, the molecular profile of many cell types remains unclear in humans. To comprehensively profile the human retina, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20,009 cells from three donors and compiled a reference transcriptome atlas. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we identified 18 transcriptionally distinct cell populations representing all known neural retinal cells: rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, M\"uller glia, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Our data captured molecular profiles for healthy and putative early degenerating rod photoreceptors, and revealed the loss of MALAT1 expression with longer post-mortem time, which potentially suggested a novel role of MALAT1 in rod photoreceptor degeneration. We have demonstrated the use of this retina transcriptome atlas to benchmark pluripotent stem cell-derived cone photoreceptors and an adult M\"uller glia cell line. This work provides an important reference with unprecedented insights into the transcriptional landscape of human retinal cells, which is fundamental to understanding retinal biology and disease.},

Using a multi-resolution network-based analysis, we identify all major retinal cell types, and their corresponding gene expression signatures. Heterogeneity is observed within macroglia, suggesting that human retinal glia are more diverse than previously thought. Finally, GWAS-based enrichment analysis identifies glia, vascular cells, and cone photoreceptors to be associated with the risk of AMD. These data provide a detailed analysis of the human retina, and show how scRNA-seq can provide insight into cell types involved in complex, inflammatory genetic diseases.},

We combined lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics, and electrophysiology of the mouse retina and showed that adult retinal microglia shared a common developmental lineage and were long-lived but resided in two distinct niches. Microglia in these niches differed in their interleukin-34 dependency and functional contribution to visual-information processing. During certain retinal-degeneration models, microglia from both pools relocated to the subretinal space, an inducible disease-associated niche that was poorly accessible to monocyte-derived cells. This microglial transition involved transcriptional reprogramming of microglia, characterized by reduced expression of homeostatic checkpoint genes and upregulation of injury-responsive genes. This transition was associated with protection of the retinal pigmented epithelium from damage caused by disease. Together, our data demonstrate that microglial function varies by retinal niche, thereby shedding light on the significance of microglia heterogeneity.},

However, reporter line development is arduous and generally limited to a single gene of interest, while single-cell RNA (scRNA)-sequencing (seq) frequently yields equivocal results that preclude definitive cell identification. To examine gene expression profiles of multiple retinal cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we performed scRNA-seq on optic vesicle (OV)-like structures cultured under cGMP-compatible conditions. However, efforts to apply traditional scRNA-seq analytical methods based on unbiased algorithms were unrevealing. Therefore, we developed a simple, versatile, and universally applicable approach that generates gene expression data akin to those obtained from reporter lines. This method ranks single cells by expression level of a bait gene and searches the transcriptome for genes whose cell-to-cell rank order expression most closely matches that of the bait. Moreover, multiple bait genes can be combined to refine datasets. Using this approach, we provide further evidence for the authenticity of hPSC-derived retinal cell types.

Here, we identify Hippo pathway-mediated repression of the transcription cofactor YAP as a core regulatory mechanism that normally blocks mammalian MG proliferation and cellular reprogramming. MG-specific deletion of Hippo pathway components Lats1 and Lats2, as well as transgenic expression of a Hippo non-responsive form of YAP (YAP5SA), resulted in dramatic Cyclin D1 upregulation, loss of adult MG identity, and attainment of a highly proliferative, progenitor-like cellular state. Our results reveal that mammalian MGs may have latent regenerative capacity that can be stimulated by repressing Hippo signaling.},

  abstract = {The human retina is a complex tissue responsible for detecting photons of light and converting information from these photons into the neurochemical signals interpreted as vision. Such visual signaling not only requires sophisticated interactions between multiple classes of neurons, but also spatially-dependent molecular specialization of individual cell types. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on neural retina isolated from both the fovea and peripheral retina in three human donors. We recovered a total of 8,217 cells, with 3,578 cells originating from the fovea and 4,639 cells originating from the periphery. Expression profiles for all major retinal cell types were compiled, and differential expression analysis was performed between cells of foveal versus peripheral origin. Globally, mRNA for the serum iron binding protein transferrin (TF), which has been associated with age-related macular degeneration pathogenesis, was enriched in peripheral samples. Cone photoreceptor cells were of particular interest and formed two predominant clusters based on gene expression. One cone cluster had 96\% of cells originating from foveal samples, while the second cone cluster consisted exclusively of peripherally isolated cells. A total of 148 genes were differentially expressed between cones from the fovea versus periphery. Interestingly, peripheral cones were enriched for the gene encoding Beta-Carotene Oxygenase 2 (BCO2). A relative deficiency of this enzyme may account for the accumulation of carotenoids responsible for yellow pigment deposition within the macula. Overall, this data set provides rich expression profiles of the major human retinal cell types and highlights transcriptomic features that distinguish foveal and peripheral cells.},

  abstract = {The human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid are complex tissues that provide crucial support to the retina. Disease affecting either of these supportive tissues can lead to irreversible blindness in the setting of age-related macular degeneration. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on macular and peripheral regions of RPE-choroid from 7 human donor eyes in 2 independent experiments. In the first experiment, total RPE/choroid preparations were evaluated and expression profiles specific to RPE and major choroidal cell populations were identified. As choroidal endothelial cells represent a minority of the total RPE/choroidal cell population but are strongly implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis, a second single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment was performed using endothelial cells enriched by magnetic separation. In this second study, we identified gene expression signatures along the choroidal vascular tree, classifying the transcriptome of human choriocapillaris, arterial, and venous endothelial cells. We found that the choriocapillaris highly and specifically expresses the regulator of cell cycle gene (RGCC), a gene that responds to complement activation and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. In addition, RGCC was the most up-regulated choriocapillaris gene in a donor diagnosed with AMD. These results provide a characterization of the human RPE and choriocapillaris transcriptome, offering potential insight into the mechanisms of choriocapillaris response to complement injury and choroidal vascular disease in age-related macular degeneration.},

  abstract = {Most irreversible blindness results from retinal disease. To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of \textasciitilde 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90\% of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

A key challenge in realizing this potential is integrating single-cell datasets from multiple protocols, biological contexts, and data modalities into a joint definition of cellular identity. We previously developed an approach, called linked inference of genomic experimental relationships (LIGER), that uses integrative nonnegative matrix factorization to address this challenge. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for using LIGER to jointly define cell types from multiple single-cell datasets. The main stages of the protocol are data preprocessing and normalization, joint factorization, quantile normalization and joint clustering, and visualization. We describe how to jointly define cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) data, but similar steps apply across a wide range of other settings and data types, including cross-species analysis, single-nucleus DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics. Our protocol contains examples of expected results, describes common pitfalls, and relies only on our freely available, open-source R implementation of LIGER. We also provide R Markdown tutorials showing the outputs from each individual code segment. The analysis process can be performed in 1\textendash 4 h, depending on dataset size, and assumes no specialized bioinformatics training.},

Here, we developed a novel deep learning algorithm to overcome batch effects using batch-aware triplet neural networks, called INSCT (``Insight''). Using simulated and real data, we demonstrate that INSCT generates an embedding space which accurately integrates cells across experiments, platforms and species. Our benchmark comparisons with current state-of-the-art scRNA-seq integration methods revealed that INSCT outperforms competing methods in scalability while achieving comparable accuracies. Moreover, using INSCT in semi-supervised mode enables users to classify unlabeled cells by projecting them into a reference collection of annotated cells. To demonstrate scalability, we applied INSCT to integrate more than 2.6 million transcriptomes from four independent studies of mouse brains in less than 1.5 hours using less than 25 gigabytes of memory. This feature empowers researchers to perform atlasing scale data integration in a typical desktop computer environment.

Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci. GENCODE 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk RNA sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of scRNA-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.},

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations.

  abstract = {Lineage development is a stepwise process, governed by stage-specific regulatory factors and associated markers. Astrocytes are one of the principle cell types in the CNS and the stages associated with their development remain very poorly defined. To identify these stages, we performed gene-expression profiling on astrocyte precursor populations in the spinal cord, identifying distinct patterns of gene induction during their development that are strongly correlated with human astrocytes. Validation studies identified a new cohort of astrocyte-associated genes during development and demonstrated their expression in reactive astrocytes in human white matter injury (WMI). Functional studies on one of these genes revealed that mice lacking Asef exhibited impaired astrocyte differentiation during development and repair after WMI, coupled with compromised blood-brain barrier integrity in the adult CNS. These studies have identified distinct stages of astrocyte lineage development associated with human WMI and, together with our functional analysis of Asef, highlight the parallels between astrocyte development and their reactive counterparts associated with injury. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Astrocytes play a central role in CNS function and associated diseases. Yet the mechanisms that control their development remain poorly defined. Using the developing mouse spinal cord as a model system, we identify molecular changes that occur in developing astrocytes. These molecular signatures are strongly correlated with human astrocyte expression profiles and validation in mouse spinal cord identifies a host of new genes associated with the astrocyte lineage. These genes are present in reactive astrocytes in human white matter injury, and functional studies reveal that one of these genes, Asef, contributes to reactive astrocyte responses after injury. These studies identify distinct stages of astrocyte lineage development and highlight the parallels between astrocyte development and their reactive counterparts associated with injury.},

  abstract = {M\"uller cells are the primary glia in the retina, playing a critical role in retinal homeostasis and retinal pathology. This study evaluated the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and its downstream effects on retinal degeneration in a transgenic mouse model of inducible M\"uller cell disruption. Increased expression of the LacZ reporter gene in the retina suggested Wnt signalling had been activated after induced M\"uller cell disruption. Activation was validated by observing nuclear translocation of {$\beta$}-Catenin. The mRNA expression of 80 Wnt related genes were assessed using real-time PCR. The Wnt signalling inhibitors Dkk1, Dkk3 and sFRP3 were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, the ubiquitin-mediated {$\beta$}-Catenin proteolysis genes {$\beta$}-TrCP and SHFM3, were also significantly downregulated. The downstream target genes of the Wnt signalling, including Fra1, CyclinD2 and C-Myc were upregulated. The changes of these genes at the protein level were validated by Western blot. Their distributions in the retina were evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. Our findings indicate that M\"uller cells are involved in retinal Wnt signalling. Activation of Wnt signalling and its downstream target genes may play important roles in photoreceptor degeneration and neovascularization occurring in the retina after induced disruption of M\"uller cells.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila bric \`a brac protein and the transcriptional regulators encoded by tramtrack and Broad-Complex contain a highly conserved domain of approximately 115 amino acids, which we have called the BTB domain. We have identified six additional Drosophila genes that encode this domain. Five of these genes are developmentally regulated, and one of them appears to be functionally related to bric \`a brac. The BTB domain defines a gene family with an estimated 40 members in Drosophila. This domain is found primarily at the N terminus of zinc finger proteins and is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to mammals.},
